The [IfG Ministers Database](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-database) provides information on all UK government ministers since Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. The database provides information on ministersâ€™ role, department, rank and dates in office.

You can look up individual ministers, specific ministerial roles, the entire government on a specific date or all those who left and entered government between two dates.

This repository contains the underlying data as well as related scripts.

# Database structure
![Database diagram of the IfG Ministers Database](IfG%20Ministers%20Database%20-%20v2.1.0%20(Current).png)

The database consists of the following tables:

## `appointment`
Links `person` and `post` records - one record per appointment.

`start_date` is always specified; `end_date` is `null` for ongoing appointments.

## `appointment_characteristics`
Each `appointment` timespan is split into one or more `appointment_characteristics` records.

The `appointment_characteristics` table records someone's `cabinet_status` - whether they were `Full cabinet`, `Attends Cabinet`, `Attends cabinet when ministerial responsibilities are on the agenda`, or `Non-cabinet` - as well as whether someone was doing a role in an acting capacity or was on leave from a role for a given time period.

`start_date` is always specified; `end_date` is `null` for ongoing appointments.

## `event`
Contains the dates of all general elections since 1979 and the day each prime minister completed their first ministerial line-up upon taking office.

## `organisation`
Contains one record for each organisation (generally a government department) at which a minister has been based.

`start_date` is always specified; `end_date` is `null` for ongoing appointments.

`short_name` is the department's initialism - note that these can be repeated.

## `organisation_link`*
Links predecessor and successor organisations.

`type` is the IfG's determination of the link - one of `Merger`, `Demerger`, `Name change`, `Transfer of functions`.

Links have an associated date range. `link_start_date` is the date the change was announced. `link_end_date` is the final date that a minister moved from the predecessor organisation to the successor organisation as part of the change. `link_start_date` and `link_end_date` are always specified.

## `person`*
Contains basic biographical details of people who have served as ministers.

Split into multiple records where someone's biographical details (name, gender) have changed.

`start_date` and `end_date` are only present where they are needed to indicate the start/end of a set of characteristics - `null` otherwise.

## `post`
Contains one record for each post that has existed at each organisation.

`rank_equivalence` is the IfG's determination of a post's rank - one of `PM`, `DPM`, `SoS`, `MoS`, `PUSS`, `Parl. lead`, `Parl.`.

## `post_relationship`
Links posts that are related to one another.

Relationships are IfG-derived and are principally based on post names, rather than a deeper analysis of ministerial responsibilities.

## `representation`
Records periods of parliamentary representation.

`start_date` is always specified; `end_date` is `null` for ongoing periods of representation.

## `representation_characteristics`
Each `representation` timespan is split into one or more `representation_characteristics` records.

`start_date` is always specified; `end_date` is `null` for ongoing periods of representation.

\
\* With the exception of these tables, tables in the database each have a separate `id` per row. This means the `organisation_link` and `person` tables are not denormalised; other tables are.

# Scripts
The `sql` directory contains scripts that power the IfG Ministers Database pages.

Subdirectories contains scripts relating to the following pages:
- `1_appointments_held_by_person`: [_Look up a minister_ page](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-database/look-minister)
- `2_persons_holding_appointment`: [_Look up a ministerial role_ page](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-database/look-ministerial-role)
- `3_appointments_at_date`: [_View entire government_ page](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-database/view-entire-government)
- `4_appointments_exits_between_dates`: [_View ministerial appointments and exits_ page](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-database/view-ministerial-appointments-and-exits)

In each case, the scripts most likely to be of use are those which populate the data tables on each page. Each is available in two forms: one which doesn't merge appointments spanning [departmental restructures](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/ministers-database/how-use-database#departmental-restructures) (`...unmerged.sql`) and one that does (`...merged.sql`). These scripts are:
- [`1_table_data_unmerged.sql`](https://github.com/instituteforgov/ifg-ministers-database-public/blob/main/sql/1_appointments_held_by_person/1_table_data_unmerged.sql), [`1_table_data_merged.sql`](https://github.com/instituteforgov/ifg-ministers-database-public/blob/main/sql/1_appointments_held_by_person/1_table_data_merged.sql),
- [`2_table_data_unmerged.sql`](https://github.com/instituteforgov/ifg-ministers-database-public/blob/main/sql/2_persons_holding_appointment/2_table_data_unmerged.sql), [`2_table_data_merged.sql`](https://github.com/instituteforgov/ifg-ministers-database-public/blob/main/sql/2_persons_holding_appointment/2_table_data_merged.sql),

- [`4_table_data_unmerged.sql`](https://github.com/instituteforgov/ifg-ministers-database-public/blob/main/sql/4_appointments_exits_between_dates/4_table_data_unmerged.sql), [`4_table_data_merged.sql`](https://github.com/instituteforgov/ifg-ministers-database-public/blob/main/sql/4_appointments_exits_between_dates/4_table_data_merged.sql),
